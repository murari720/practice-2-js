This repository contains three simple JavaScript DOM manipulation projects:

1. Live Character Counter for Textarea  
2. Product Filter Webpage  
3. Interactive SVG Drawing Tool  

Each project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling events and dynamically updating the webpage without reloading.

## 1. Live Character Counter for Textarea

### Title  
Live Character Counter for Textarea

### Objective  
To create a simple feature that displays a live character count as the user types in a textarea. This project demonstrates real-time event handling and dynamic DOM updates using JavaScript.

### Task Description  
- A textarea is provided for the user to type text.  
- A character counter is displayed below the textarea.  
- The counter updates immediately as the user types or deletes content.  

### How It Works  
1. The textarea element is placed in the HTML.  
2. A `<p>` tag is used to show the character count.  
3. JavaScript uses the `input` event to track changes in the textarea.  
4. The character count updates dynamically without reloading the page.

# Web Development Mini Projects

This repository contains three simple JavaScript DOM manipulation projects:

2. Product Filter Webpage  
3. Interactive SVG Drawing Tool  

Each project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling events and dynamically updating the webpage without reloading.

# Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown

## Title  
Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown using JavaScript DOM Manipulation

## Objective  
To build a web-based product list that can dynamically filter and display items based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu. This helps in practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and updating elements in real time.

## Task Description  
- A list of products is displayed on the webpage.  
- A dropdown menu with options like **All, Category 1, Category 2, ...** is placed above the product list.  
- When the user selects a category from the dropdown, only the matching products are displayed.  
- If "All" is selected, all products appear again.  
- The filtering is done dynamically with JavaScript (no page reload).  

## How It Works  
1. Each product in the list has a `data-category` attribute.  
2. The dropdown menu allows users to choose a category.  
3. JavaScript listens for the `change` event on the dropdown.  
4. Products are shown/hidden dynamically depending on the selected category.

# Interactive SVG Drawing Tool

## Title  
Interactive SVG Drawing Tool with Mouse Event Handlers

## Objective  
To design and build a web-based drawing tool using SVG where users can interactively draw shapes with their mouse. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation, SVG element creation, and handling mouse events in real time.

## Task Description  
- Create a webpage with an **SVG area** that acts as a drawing canvas.  
- When the user **clicks and drags** inside the SVG area, a shape (for example, a rectangle or line) should be drawn.  
- The shape updates dynamically as the user moves the mouse.  
- On releasing the mouse button, the shape is finalized.  
- Users can draw multiple shapes by repeating the click-and-drag action.  
- All interactions must be handled with JavaScript without reloading the page.  

## How It Works  
1. The SVG area is created in the HTML file.  
2. JavaScript listens to three main mouse events:  
   - **mousedown** → Start drawing and create a new shape.  
   - **mousemove** → Update the size of the shape as the mouse moves.  
   - **mouseup** → Finalize the shape.  
3. Each drawing is stored inside the SVG so multiple shapes can be created.
